# Interview take-home assigment

## Info

In this brach I tried to implement the solution using a different data structure for storing the table data. The data are "flattened" so the child nodes aren't inside of the parent but instead on the same level. The parent then only needs to store an array of the child ids, not the whole child objects.

## Scripts

- `dev`/`start` - start dev server and open browser
- `build` - build for production
- `preview` - locally preview production build
- `test` - launch test runner
